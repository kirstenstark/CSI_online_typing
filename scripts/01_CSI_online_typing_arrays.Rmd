```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load packages
```{r load packages}
summary(cars)
```

## Load arrays
```{r load data}
options( "encoding" = "UTF-8" )
arrays <- read_delim(here::here("data", "arrays.csv"), 
    ";", escape_double = FALSE, na = "NA", 
    trim_ws = TRUE)
# delete empty lines
arrays %>% filter()

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
